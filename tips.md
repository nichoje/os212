1. Quiz Time<br>
I think the quiz time limit (5 minutes for multiple choice and 15 minutes for essay) is too short. So we must do researches the day before. 

2. Listen and Pay Attention to the Lecturer<br>
Sometimes there will be passphrase for the assignment. So pay attention.

3. Do GSGS!<br>
Anything you don't understand? GSGS! Google has almost everything you need.

4. Do the assignments properly!<br>
It is a must to do every assignments properly so you can get good scores!
